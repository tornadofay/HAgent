# Current project state

## Project

HAgent is a lightweight, provider-neutral .NET cognition and execution runtime. Its purpose is to provide reusable LLM infrastructure for software projects of different types without requiring HAgent.Core to understand any host-specific domain model.

## Supported targets

- .NET Framework 4.8.1
- .NET 9 where supported
- No GPU requirement
- Low-memory operation is a design constraint

## Current milestone

**0.8 Data Access + Authorization — active**

0.7 WinForms UI Context + Data Discovery is complete and locally verified.

0.9 Runtime Agent Instances foundations are complete and documented.

0.10 Workspaces, Routing + Chat is the current active feature milestone in `docs/plan/20-active.md`.

0.95 Generic External Host Integration remains a planned cross-cutting hardening phase.

The next major capability layer after the current workspace work is **Knowledge + Skills + Memory Governance + Learning**, including management UI and profile/runtime capability controls.

## Verified implementation

The repository currently contains verified foundations for:

- provider/agent configuration and routing;
- execution lifecycle, timeout, cancellation, retries, diagnostics, and failure reporting;
- memory, persistent sessions, context budgeting, automatic/episodic/task memory;
- capability discovery and response normalization;
- streaming contracts and live streaming;
- tool definitions, registry, schema validation, provider transport, bounded tool loops, persistence, and per-agent assignment;
- WinForms UI Context with Form/UserControl attachment;
- semantic control and bound/native data-source discovery;
- CurrencyManager/current-item/source relationships;
- control-to-source relationship discovery;
- convention-based custom control adaptation;
- bounded application-object discovery;
- provider-neutral structured data projection/query contracts;
- runtime-instance foundations including independent runtime identity, lifecycle, memory ownership, execution revisions, scheduling, and optional runtime-state persistence;
- HAgent.Example verification for completed capabilities.

## Planned Knowledge / Skills / Learning layer

The next capability layer must establish one coherent model rather than treating Wiki, Skills, and Memory as unrelated features:

```text
Skills    = reusable executable capabilities
Knowledge = reusable retrievable information
Wiki      = managed persistent knowledge source
Memory    = scoped experience/state
Learning  = controlled transformation of experience into typed candidates
```

Learning candidates are typed as `MemoryCandidate`, `KnowledgeCandidate`, or `SkillCandidate` and retain provenance/evidence. Candidate creation does not automatically make information authoritative.

`LearningMode` is configurable as:

- `Disabled` — no learning candidates;
- `SuggestOnly` — candidates are reviewable but not promoted automatically;
- `AutomaticWithPolicy` — explicit policy may promote approved candidate classes/scopes;
- `FullyAutomatic` — explicit advanced opt-in for automatic promotion.

The default governance target is `SuggestOnly` unless the existing configuration model establishes a safer default during implementation.

## Capability configuration target

Agent profiles provide reusable defaults. A runtime instance inherits those defaults and can apply runtime-only tri-state overrides (`Inherit`, `Enabled`, `Disabled`). The policy must support at least:

- skill capability and individual skill resources;
- Wiki/knowledge capability and individual knowledge resources;
- memory capability and individual memory families/types;
- future resource types through a generic resource/type ID model.

Execution snapshots capture the effective policy so configuration or runtime changes cannot alter already-running work.

## Management UI target

`HAgent.WinForms` must add:

- Learning Review: pending suggestions, provenance/evidence, source execution/runtime, proposed scope, approve/reject;
- Wiki/Knowledge Manager: new/edit/delete, search/filter, relationships, and which agents use/access each resource;
- Skill Manager: new/edit/delete, version/status, relationships, and which agents use each skill;
- Agent Configuration knowledge view: when an agent is selected, show effective Skills, Wiki/Knowledge access, Memory families, and all other resource types exposed by the generic inventory;
- profile-level enable/disable and runtime-instance-level overrides for skills, Wiki/knowledge, and individual memory types.

The agent knowledge view must be future-proof: known types may have specialized UI, but unknown/new types remain visible through the generic resource inventory rather than requiring a new hard-coded agent property.

## Boundaries

Knowledge, skills, memory, learning, and their management UI remain HAgent-owned generic infrastructure. No host-specific application or HWorld type may be introduced into Core.

Storage implementations remain responsible for persistence. WinForms owns administration surfaces. The model is never the authorization authority; learning promotion and capability enforcement occur through code/policy.

## Planned generic integration hardening

Phase 0.95 will complete the generic host boundary required for a broad class of LLM-driven software:

- arbitrary bounded host execution input/context;
- host-supplied correlation identity;
- host-defined structured-output contracts and validation;
- race-safe terminal execution semantics against late provider completion;
- runtime/execution identity propagation into tool execution;
- stronger isolation of mutable runtime overrides;
- deterministic verification of concurrent independent runtime instances.

These changes must remain provider-neutral and domain-neutral. Host state, lifecycle, scheduling policy, persistence, authorization, and side effects remain host-owned.

## Active implementation

The active implementation plan is the current file `docs/plan/20-active.md`. It must contain only work being implemented now; the Knowledge/Skills/Learning layer is planned until the workspace milestone changes the active slice.

## Verification rule

A capability becomes complete only after its implementation exists, its matching `HAgent.Example` verification passes locally, and the project documentation reflects the result.

Do not claim local build/test success unless it was actually performed.

## Documentation ownership

- `README.md` — public introduction and quick start.
- `AGENTS.md` — non-negotiable engineering and repository rules.
- `docs/architecture/` — stable architectural design and boundaries.
- `docs/plan/` — master direction, current state, and active implementation only.
- `docs/roadmap/` — ordered path from completed foundations to the long-term target.
- `docs/storage.md` — persistence/backend details.

The root `plan.md` and `roadmap.md` are generated from their source directories. They are views, not independent sources of truth.
