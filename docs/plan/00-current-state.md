# Current project state

## Project

HAgent is a lightweight, provider-neutral .NET cognition and execution runtime. Its purpose is to provide reusable LLM infrastructure for software projects of different types without requiring HAgent.Core to understand any host-specific domain model.

## Supported targets

- .NET Framework 4.8.1
- .NET 9 where supported
- No GPU requirement
- Low-memory operation is a design constraint

## Current milestone

**0.10 Workspaces, Routing + Chat — paused after routing/role-policy foundation**

0.7 WinForms UI Context + Data Discovery is complete and locally verified.

0.8 Data Access + Authorization + Internal Storage foundations are substantially implemented and manually verified across supported storage backends; remaining internal repository parity is intentionally deferred.

0.9 Runtime Agent Instances is complete for the generic runtime contract and manually verified through deterministic Example coverage. HWorld is an external consumer rather than an HAgent dependency.

0.95 Generic External Host Integration is complete and verified on .NET Framework 4.8.1 and .NET 9, including canonical generic execution requests, provider-facing request isolation, structured-output validation/native transport, terminal-state protection, runtime snapshot isolation, external-consumer verification, and composition of long-lived runtime instances with canonical execution requests.

0.10 Workspaces, Routing + Chat has a verified routing and role-policy foundation and is now intentionally paused. The remaining workspace product work is deferred while earlier provider/runtime capability gaps are investigated and corrected.

The next capability work should resume only after the provider/model capability model is mature enough to support heterogeneous environments safely. Knowledge + Skills + Memory Governance + Learning remains the later capability layer.

## Verified implementation

The repository currently contains verified foundations for:

- provider/agent configuration and routing;
- execution lifecycle, timeout, cancellation, retries, diagnostics, and failure reporting;
- memory, persistent sessions, context budgeting, automatic/episodic/task memory;
- capability discovery and response normalization;
- streaming contracts and live streaming;
- tool definitions, registry, schema validation, provider transport, bounded tool loops, persistence, and per-agent assignment;
- WinForms UI Context with Form/UserControl attachment;
- semantic control and bound/native data-source discovery;
- CurrencyManager/current-item/source relationships;
- control-to-source relationship discovery;
- convention-based custom control adaptation;
- bounded application-object discovery;
- provider-neutral structured data projection/query contracts;
- HAgent-owned storage configuration for File, SQL Server, and MySQL backends;
- application-specific File storage layout;
- HAgent-owned SQL Server/MySQL database bootstrap foundations;
- bounded internal inventory, memory, conversation, and execution-audit read tools;
- automatic payload-free execution auditing with configurable bounded retention;
- runtime-instance identity, scope, runtime-only overrides, independent memory ownership, concurrent execution, stale-result protection, host-controlled scheduling, shutdown semantics, and optional runtime-state persistence;
- provider-neutral workspace participants, message metadata, default-recipient routing, and coordinator/specialist role policy;
- generic host execution requests with multiple messages, host correlation identity, bounded host context, provider-facing request isolation, native structured-output transport/fallback, terminal-state protection, runtime snapshot isolation, verified external-consumer coverage on both supported target frameworks, and verified runtime-instance + canonical-request composition.

## Paused Workspace target

Phase 0.10 initially provides one default persisted workspace per host user. The host supplies a stable `UserId`, display identity, and `IsAdmin` identity. Database-backed persistence is partitioned by host application identity and user identity; File storage remains local to the host installation.

Workspace visibility is always explicit: the workspace is hidden until the host opens it. `Create`, `Open/Show`, `Hide`, and `Close` are separate lifecycle operations, and closing the UI never destroys persisted workspace state. The model remains extensible to multiple named workspaces later.

The workspace product target includes a shared Lobby, distinct user-to-agent Private Chats, agent join/leave, coordinator/specialist defaults, permitted provider/agent/model selection and runtime overrides, integrated approval requests/resolution, safe activity/statistics, unread/last-seen state, bounded presentation of tables/charts/graphs and popup/detail results, and modern WinForms presentation through a public host-facing workspace facade.

Provider secrets, connection strings, live provider tasks, live `CancellationToken` state, runtime synchronization primitives, raw HTTP requests, raw provider payloads, and temporary execution objects remain outside persisted workspace state; these exclusions were established by Phase 0.95.

## Provider/model capability gap under investigation

HAgent must operate across heterogeneous providers, deployments, and models where capabilities and operational limits differ. A provider name alone is not sufficient to describe what an execution target can do.

The architecture investigation will establish a provider-neutral capability model covering at least:

```text
provider
deployment/account/project policy
model
model version/revision
capabilities
request limits
context/output limits
rate/concurrency limits
runtime availability
```

Capabilities must be treated as request requirements rather than assumed model properties. Candidate capabilities include text generation, structured output, tool calling, reasoning, image input, image output/generation, audio input/output, embeddings, and other future modalities/features.

The effective capability of an execution target may be `Supported`, `Unsupported`, or `Unknown`, and must distinguish declared capability from runtime/account policy, quota, temporary availability, and request-specific constraints. HAgent should validate or select an execution target before sending provider requests and must have explicit fallback/degradation semantics when a requested capability is unavailable.

The next implementation investigation is provider/model capability discovery and capability-aware request planning; this is not part of the paused 0.10 workspace product.

## Planned Knowledge / Skills / Learning layer

The next capability layer must establish one coherent model rather than treating Wiki, Skills, and Memory as unrelated features:

```text
Skills    = reusable executable capabilities
Knowledge = reusable retrievable information
Wiki      = managed persistent knowledge source
Memory    = scoped experience/state
Learning  = controlled transformation of experience into typed candidates
```

Learning candidates are typed as `MemoryCandidate`, `KnowledgeCandidate`, or `SkillCandidate` and retain provenance/evidence. Candidate creation does not automatically make information authoritative.

`LearningMode` is configurable as:

- `Disabled` — no learning candidates;
- `SuggestOnly` — candidates are reviewable but not promoted automatically;
- `AutomaticWithPolicy` — explicit policy may promote approved candidate classes/scopes;
- `FullyAutomatic` — explicit advanced opt-in for automatic promotion.

The default governance target is `SuggestOnly` unless the existing configuration model establishes a safer default during implementation.

## Capability configuration target

Agent profiles provide reusable defaults. A runtime instance inherits those defaults and can apply runtime-only tri-state overrides (`Inherit`, `Enabled`, `Disabled`). The policy must support at least:

- skill capability and individual skill resources;
- Wiki/knowledge capability and individual knowledge resources;
- memory capability and individual memory families/types;
- future resource types through a generic resource/type ID model.

Execution snapshots capture the effective policy so configuration or runtime changes cannot alter already-running work.

## Management UI target

`HAgent.WinForms` must add:

- Learning Review: pending suggestions, provenance/evidence, source execution/runtime, proposed scope, approve/reject;
- Wiki/Knowledge Manager: new/edit/delete, search/filter, relationships, and which agents use/access each resource;
- Skill Manager: new/edit/delete, version/status, relationships, and which agents use each skill;
- Agent Configuration knowledge view: when an agent is selected, show effective Skills, Wiki/Knowledge access, Memory families, and all other resource types exposed by the generic inventory;
- profile-level enable/disable and runtime-instance-level overrides for skills, Wiki/knowledge, and individual memory types.

The agent knowledge view must be future-proof: known types may have specialized UI, but unknown/new types remain visible through the generic resource inventory rather than requiring a new hard-coded agent property.

## Boundaries

Knowledge, skills, memory, learning, workspace state, and workspace management UI remain HAgent-owned generic infrastructure. No host-specific application or HWorld type may be introduced into Core.

Storage implementations remain responsible for persistence. WinForms owns administration/presentation surfaces. The model is never the authorization authority; learning promotion, workspace approvals, and capability enforcement occur through code/policy.

## Active implementation

The active implementation plan remains `docs/plan/20-active.md`, which currently records the paused 0.10 milestone. Provider/model capability discovery and capability-aware planning are the current investigation target before workspace implementation resumes.

## Verification rule

A capability becomes complete only after its implementation exists, its matching `HAgent.Example` verification passes locally, and the project documentation reflects the result.

Do not claim local build/test success unless it was actually performed.
