## HAgent Roadmap

The roadmap is the ordered implementation path toward the HAgent master plan. Stable architectural definitions belong under `docs/architecture/`, and current work belongs under `docs/plan/`.

## Current position

- 0.1–0.2 — foundations complete
- 0.3–0.4 — memory/context and provider-capability foundations complete
- 0.5 — tool foundation complete; hardening remains
- 0.6 — safety/permission foundation complete; broader authorization remains
- 0.7 — WinForms UI Context + Data Discovery complete and locally verified
- 0.8 — Data Access + Authorization + Internal Storage foundations substantially implemented; Skills/Wiki management and broader knowledge governance were deferred
- 0.9 — Runtime Agent Instances complete and locally verified
- 0.95 — Generic External Host Integration **complete and verified on .NET Framework 4.8.1 and .NET 9**
- 0.10 — Workspaces, Routing + Chat — active; routing foundation locally verified and coordinator/specialist role policy implementation in progress
- 0.11 — Knowledge, Skills, Memory Governance + Learning **planned next major feature layer**
- 1.0 — Collaboration + Workflows
- Later — provider ecosystem, extensibility, developer platform, release hardening

Phase 0.11 converts existing memory/skill/wiki foundations into a coherent scoped resource model and adds controlled learning, review, capability inheritance, runtime overrides, and management UI. It must consume the generic runtime contracts rather than create project-specific exceptions.

Phase 0.95 is a completed cross-cutting runtime/API hardening phase. It established the generic execution boundary for arbitrary hosts: host input/context, host correlation, structured output contracts and validation, provider-facing request isolation, execution terminality, tool identity propagation, runtime snapshot isolation, provider-native structured-output transport, and external-consumer verification. It does not introduce any host-specific domain dependency.

The roadmap distinguishes feature phases from generic runtime hardening. Higher-level features may continue later, but they must consume the generic contracts rather than create project-specific exceptions.

External consumers use HAgent through public provider-neutral APIs. HAgent does not contain consumer-specific dependencies or domain logic.

## Foundations — 0.1 through 0.7

This file records the completed foundation path and the remaining hardening work that grows directly out of those phases. It is the roadmap's implementation history; the master plan does not repeat these checklists.

## Foundation exit

These phases establish the base on which the remaining roadmap is built. The next work is not another UI discovery feature; it is safe real data access followed by the runtime-agent model required for multi-agent hosts and HWorld.

## Phase 0.8 — Data Access + Authorization + Internal Storage

## Goal

Provide bounded structured data contracts and establish HAgent-owned persistence across File, SQL Server, and MySQL backends without ever using HAgent storage as access to a host application's business database.

## Steps

1. [x] Application-owned structured-query contract and authoritative field schema.
2. [x] Separate data-operation permissions and request-specific host authorization contracts.
3. [x] Query/result limits, cancellation, timeout, and resource budgets.
4. [x] HAgent internal storage backend configuration for File, SQL Server, and MySQL.
5. [x] Application-specific File storage layout.
6. [x] SQL Server HAgent database creation and initial schema bootstrap.
7. [x] MySQL HAgent database creation and initial schema bootstrap.
8. [ ] Wire providers, agents, tools, memory, conversations, skills, wiki/content, learning candidates, and runtime repositories to the selected backend.
9. [x] Versioned schema migrations beyond the initial bootstrap version.
10. [ ] Read-only HAgent internal data tools, audit/correlation metadata, and live Example verification before any internal writes beyond repository persistence.

The read-only foundation now includes bounded provider/agent/tool inventory, memory inspection with scope/owner isolation, explicit-session conversation inspection, and execution-audit inspection. Execution audit persistence is available through File, SQL Server, and MySQL using a secret-safe payload-free record.

## Internal database naming

The default HAgent database name is derived from the host application name using `<application-name>-ai`, for example `nap-ai` or `hworld-ai`. The database name is controlled by HAgent storage naming rules and is not a user-editable field in the Storage UI.

## File backend

File storage is application-specific and rooted beneath the host executable directory in `HAgentData`, with dedicated areas for configuration, providers, agents, tools, skills, memory, conversations, wiki, runtime, cache, logs, and audit data. Future learning/knowledge-governance records remain HAgent-owned and must use additive schema/layout changes rather than host databases.

## Database backends

SQL Server and MySQL storage providers receive server name and username as persisted configuration metadata and a password through the secret/runtime boundary. They connect to the server, create the HAgent-owned database if it does not exist, and initialize only HAgent-owned tables. Schema version metadata supports deterministic migrations.

The internal database schema includes provider, agent, tool, memory, conversation, execution-audit, skill, wiki document/chunk, and schema metadata areas. Phase 0.11 will add the HAgent-owned persistence required for knowledge resources, skill versions/relationships, learning candidates/review state, capability assignments/overrides, and extensible memory-type policy.

## Audit foundation

`AgentExecution` carries an execution-level correlation ID. `AgentExecutionAuditRecord` projects only execution/correlation identity, agent/provider/model metadata, lifecycle timing, state, and classified failure metadata. Prompts, responses, provider secrets, secret IDs, connection strings, raw exceptions, and other payloads are excluded.

`IExecutionAuditStore` provides bounded append/search persistence. File uses an HAgent-owned `audit/executions.jsonl` file; SQL Server and MySQL use the HAgent-owned `HAgentExecutionAudits` table.

## Live Example

The Example storage verification will exercise File, SQL Server, and MySQL initialization where the corresponding backend is configured. It will verify database creation when absent, idempotent initialization when present, schema version reporting, persistence through the HAgent repositories, execution-audit round trips, and strict separation from host application data.

## Boundaries

- No raw SQL from model input.
- No implicit access to the host application's business database.
- HAgent storage providers are internal persistence providers, not host database adapters.
- Database passwords remain in the secret/runtime boundary.
- UI discovery, object provenance, and model instructions do not grant database authorization.
- Learning candidates and knowledge/skill management remain HAgent-owned data and do not grant host-business-data access.

## Exit criterion

A host can select an HAgent-owned storage backend, initialize or upgrade it deterministically, and use HAgent repositories against it without HAgent gaining access to the host application's business database.

## Phase 0.9 — Runtime Agent Instances

## Goal
Make live agents first-class runtime objects separate from reusable agent profiles.

## Steps

1. [x] Introduce a provider-neutral runtime agent instance with its own stable instance ID and profile reference.
2. [x] Define explicit provider-neutral runtime scopes.
3. [x] Allow runtime-specific context and provider/model overrides without mutating stored profiles.
4. [x] Give each runtime instance an independent memory owner.
5. [x] Support multiple runtime instances executing concurrently.
6. [x] Expose asynchronous scheduling, cancellation, timeout, correlation, and stale-result protection foundations.
7. [x] Define explicit active/retired/shutdown lifecycle behavior.
8. [x] Keep dynamically created agents out of persistent configuration by default.
9. [x] Add optional runtime-state persistence for recovery, collaboration, or multi-process deployments.
10. [x] Verify the runtime contract with deterministic Example coverage.
11. [ ] Complete generic external-host execution boundary hardening in Phase 0.95.

## Runtime rule

One configured profile can produce many live instances. Runtime roles are host policy over the same generic runtime model, not separate agent classes.

Runtime-only provider, model, generation, system-prompt, context, and capability overrides are applied to execution snapshots created from the persistent profile. They never mutate the stored profile. Runtime configuration remains distinct from per-execution host input.

Each runtime instance owns private memory through its `MemoryOwnerId`, keeping private agent-scoped memory separate across instances created from the same profile. Shared memory is possible only through an explicit shared scope and authorization policy.

Each instance-bound execution receives a monotonically increasing instance revision. Hosts can use `AgentRuntimeInstance.IsExecutionCurrent(execution)` to reject late results after a newer execution starts or the instance is retired. The generic execution hardening phase additionally ensures late provider completion cannot overwrite a terminal execution outcome.

Retirement and shutdown are separate lifecycle operations. Retirement prevents new executions and invalidates result authority while allowing already-running work to finish or be cancelled by the host. Shutdown is terminal, prevents new executions, invalidates result authority, and requests cancellation of outstanding instance-bound executions.

`IAgentExecutionScheduler` and the default `AgentExecutionScheduler` provide an optional host-controlled admission boundary with a configurable concurrency limit. The scheduler does not own host timing or replace runtime execution semantics.

Capability policy and learning are layered above this runtime foundation. Phase 0.11 resolves profile capability defaults plus runtime tri-state overrides (`Inherit`, `Enabled`, `Disabled`) into each execution snapshot. Learning operates on execution experience and never mutates runtime identity directly.

## External-host relationship

Phase 0.9 establishes the runtime-instance foundation. Phase 0.95 completes the generic execution boundary required for external hosts: arbitrary host input/context, host correlation, structured output contracts, terminal execution semantics, and tool identity propagation. Phase 0.11 consumes these runtime guarantees for scoped knowledge, Skills, Memory, Learning, and management UI.

## Exit criterion

A host can create, run, cancel, and retire multiple independent runtime agents from reusable profiles without identity, private-memory, or execution-state collisions. Later phases may layer reusable Skills, Knowledge/Wiki, Memory governance, and Learning without weakening runtime isolation.

## Phase 0.95 — Generic External Host Integration

## Status

**Complete — verified on .NET Framework 4.8.1 and .NET 9.**

## Goal

Complete the provider-neutral execution boundary required by arbitrary host applications without coupling HAgent.Core to a host domain, UI framework, scheduler, persistence model, or side-effect system.

## Requirements

1. [x] Introduce a canonical `AgentExecutionRequest` carrying multiple messages, host-supplied bounded context, runtime overrides, and execution options.
2. [x] Preserve plain string message execution as a convenience overload over the canonical request boundary.
3. [x] Preserve host-supplied correlation identity separately from `AgentExecution.Id` and `AgentRuntimeInstance.InstanceId`.
4. [x] Propagate execution, runtime-instance, tool-call, tool, and host correlation identity through tool execution metadata.
5. [x] Define a host-owned `StructuredOutputOptions` request contract with HAgent-side validation.
6. [x] Request structured output through capable provider adapters rather than relying on post-generation JSON detection alone.
7. [x] Validate normalized structured output against the requested schema and expose normalized validation/result metadata.
8. [x] Preserve provider capability distinction for structured output (`Supported`, `Unsupported`, `Unknown`).
9. [x] Make execution terminal-state transitions race-safe so late provider completion cannot overwrite cancellation, timeout, retirement, shutdown, or another terminal outcome.
10. [x] Preserve independent runtime-instance identity, overrides, execution state, shutdown lifecycle, and private memory ownership when multiple instances originate from one profile.
11. [x] Snapshot runtime overrides and host context at the execution/instance boundary so mutable caller-owned state cannot create cross-instance coupling.
12. [x] Keep host scheduling external; HAgent provides only focused admission-control primitives.
13. [x] Preserve host ownership of domain state, persistence, authorization, scheduling policy, and side effects.
14. [x] Add deterministic Example verification covering generic execution input, host correlation, structured output, late completion protection, tool identity propagation, concurrent runtime instances, and memory isolation.
15. [x] Define and verify a provider-facing `ProviderExecutionRequest` boundary separate from the host-facing request.
16. [x] Route normal, tool-calling, and streaming provider adapter contracts through `ProviderExecutionRequest`.
17. [x] Use provider-facing structured-output requirements for provider-native constrained generation where supported, with controlled fallback and continued HAgent validation.
18. [x] Add and verify an external-consumer smoke sample representing a host consuming the HAgent production surface on both supported target frameworks.
19. [x] Compose a long-lived `AgentRuntimeInstance` with the canonical `AgentExecutionRequest` through `HAgentClient.ExecuteAsync(instance, request, cancellationToken)`, preserving request input/context/correlation/structured-output semantics while the instance supplies runtime identity, revision, overrides, lifecycle, and private-memory ownership. Verified by `RUNTIME INSTANCE REQUEST` on the Example application.

## API direction

The public integration shape is:

```text
Host
  -> AgentRuntimeInstance (optional long-lived execution identity)
  + AgentExecutionRequest (execution input/context)
  -> HAgentClient.ExecuteAsync(instance, request, ...)
  -> AgentExecution
```

The runtime instance and execution request are orthogonal. The runtime instance answers **who is executing**; the request answers **what is being executed**. The request must not absorb the runtime instance because runtime ownership, lifecycle, revision, overrides, shutdown signaling, and private-memory ownership belong to the instance boundary.

After HAgent resolves the agent/provider/runtime state, the provider adapter receives:

```text
AgentExecutionRequest + runtime-derived execution options
  -> ProviderExecutionRequest
  -> provider adapter
  -> normalized AIResponse
```

The request boundaries remain generic. HAgent does not define host-domain schemas, event types, command types, domain objects, or lifecycle policy.

## Runtime invariants

One reusable profile may produce many long-lived runtime instances. Every runtime instance remains independently addressable and owns its own runtime lifecycle, execution revision, override snapshot, shutdown signaling, and private memory ownership.

When an execution is started from a runtime instance, `request.AgentId` must match `instance.ProfileId`. The caller's request/options objects are not mutated to attach runtime identity; HAgent creates the effective execution request/options internally.

An execution that has reached a terminal outcome cannot later publish a conflicting outcome because a provider completed late. Non-cooperative providers may continue executing after HAgent has completed cancellation/timeout handling, but their late results cannot regain authority over the terminal execution state.

## Structured-output invariant

A structured-output response is valid only when the requested contract is successfully honored and validated. Arbitrary JSON text is not sufficient evidence that the contract was satisfied.

Provider-native constrained generation is opportunistic. When an OpenAI-compatible endpoint supports the native `response_format`/JSON Schema request shape, the adapter uses it. If the endpoint explicitly reports that feature as unsupported or unknown, the adapter may retry without the native field. HAgent validation remains authoritative in either path.

## External consumer verification

`samples/HAgent.ExternalConsumer` is a standalone host sample that references the broad HAgent production surface available to an application: Core, the OpenAI-compatible provider transport, File storage, SQL Server storage, MySQL storage, and WinForms. It owns its own host-side test data/provider and does not introduce HWorld-specific domain logic into HAgent. The sample has been executed successfully on both `.NET Framework 4.8.1` and `.NET 9`.

A real host is not required to reference every HAgent assembly in production; it selects the modules it needs. The sample is intentionally broad so this milestone verifies the public HAgent system surface rather than only `HAgent.Core`.

## HWorld boundary

HWorld is an external consumer. HAgent does not contain an HWorld dependency, adapter, physics, rendering, simulation-time, or action-authority code. HWorld references the HAgent modules it needs and owns its own domain lifecycle, scheduling, state, authorization, and side effects.

## Exit criterion

A host can submit a complete provider-neutral execution request with bounded context, host correlation, and optional structured-output requirements; HAgent can execute that request either directly or through a long-lived runtime instance without losing request semantics or runtime ownership. HAgent resolves the request into a provider-facing request, invokes an adapter, normalizes the response, validates host-owned contracts, preserves execution identity, protects terminal state, and isolates runtime snapshots without coupling to host or provider-specific domain models. A standalone external consumer representing the HAgent production surface demonstrated the public boundary on both supported target frameworks, and runtime-instance execution composes the canonical request through the verified instance/request API.

## Phase 0.10 — Workspaces, Routing + Chat

## Goal
Provide an optional shared conversation where one authenticated host user and multiple runtime agents can visibly work together while every model request is routed deliberately and the user's workspace state survives application restarts.

## Steps

1. [x] Introduce a workspace abstraction independent of WinForms.
2. [x] Register users and runtime-agent participants with explicit lifecycle state.
3. [x] Define one workspace default recipient for unaddressed user messages.
4. [x] Define direct user-to-agent addressing.
5. [x] Define addressed agent-to-agent delegation and responses.
6. [x] Define coordinator/specialist behavior as a role/policy over generic runtime agents. `WORKSPACE ROLES` Example verification complete.
7. [ ] Allow specialists to represent whole domains, tables, subsystems, or other host responsibilities.
8. [x] Preserve sender, recipient, correlation, causation, ordering, and routing metadata.
9. [ ] Execute routed workspace messages through runtime agents and make agent-to-agent work visible in the workspace lobby when enabled.
10. [ ] Add configurable addressing syntax at the host/UI layer without making prompt text the authoritative routing mechanism.
11. [ ] Add loop protection and collaboration budgets.
12. [ ] Add optional persistent workspace state and explicit shared-memory policy.
13. [ ] Add the WinForms workspace surface and global agent selection.
14. [ ] Add stable host user identity input, including `UserId` and `IsAdmin`, with database-safe user/workspace partitioning.
15. [ ] Add create/open/show/hide/close workspace lifecycle APIs where UI close never destroys persisted workspace state.
16. [ ] Persist user-owned lobby chat, private-agent chat, participant membership/roles, approval state, safe statistics, and selected workspace UX state according to storage policy.
17. [ ] Add user-facing workspace configuration with a single `Enable Workspace` setting; workspace remains hidden until explicitly opened.
18. [ ] Add default manager/coordinator agent configuration.
19. [ ] Add default specialist agent configuration and specialist responsibility metadata.
20. [ ] Add workspace/private-chat provider and agent selection/override controls without mutating persistent agent profiles.
21. [ ] Add configurable default approval type/policy and integrate approval requests/resolution into workspace UI and conversation history.
22. [ ] Add professional modern WinForms UI with lobby chat, participant/agent list, private chats, approval presentation, and explicit open/close/show/hide controls.
23. [ ] Add Example controls and tests for create, open/show, hide, close UI, agent join/leave, lobby chat, private chat, approval flow, persistence across restart, and user/workspace restoration.
24. [ ] Verify SQL Server, MySQL, and File workspace persistence and user partitioning.

### Current foundation

The provider-neutral foundation contains `AgentWorkspace`, `WorkspaceParticipant`, `WorkspaceMessage`, `IWorkspaceRouter`, and `WorkspaceRouter`. Participants are either users or runtime agents and have explicit Active/Suspended/Retired state. An active default recipient may be defined for unaddressed user messages. Routing does not invoke providers, mutate agent profiles, or perform host side effects.

`IWorkspaceRolePolicy` and `WorkspaceRolePolicy` allow coordinator/specialist behavior to be expressed as policy over ordinary agent participants. `WorkspaceAgentRoleAssignment` describes `Participant`, `Coordinator`, or `Specialist` role, optional responsibility metadata, user-message eligibility, and allowed delegation target roles. No separate coordinator/specialist agent classes are introduced. The `WORKSPACE ROLES` Example verification confirms the policy works.

The workspace user identity contract must carry a stable `UserId` and an `IsAdmin` flag supplied by the host. The identity is an input to workspace authorization and persistence partitioning; `IsAdmin` does not itself grant tool, memory, data, or host-business permissions.

Phase 0.10 initially provides one default persisted workspace per user. The model should remain extensible to multiple named workspaces later without forcing a second workspace into the first implementation.

## Workspace lifecycle

The workspace UI is hidden until explicitly opened by the host. There is no automatic-show workspace behavior in Phase 0.10.

`Create`/ensure obtains the user's default workspace. `Open`/`Show` makes the UI visible. `Hide` hides it without changing workspace state. `Close` closes the UI without deleting workspace state. Destructive archive/deletion is a separate explicit operation and is not implied by closing the UI.

Application shutdown or computer shutdown must not cause user work to disappear. Reopening the application with the same stable `UserId` restores the persisted workspace state from the selected HAgent storage backend.

## Conversations

The workspace contains a shared Lobby conversation where the user and joined agents can visibly communicate. It also contains distinct Private Chats between the user and selected agents. Private chat content is not automatically exposed to other workspace participants.

Visible messages identify their author and role clearly. System and approval events are first-class workspace-visible events alongside ordinary conversation messages.

## Agent configuration

The host/application administrator can configure default manager/coordinator and specialist agents for the workspace. A specialist has descriptive responsibility metadata that can represent a domain, table, subsystem, process, capability, or other host-owned responsibility without requiring HAgent-specific domain classes.

The workspace UI can let a user switch the active provider/model or selected agent for an allowed conversation or private chat. These are execution/runtime selections and do not silently mutate the stored `AiAgent` profile.

The default approval type/policy is a workspace/host policy default. Approval handling remains subject to HAgent authorization and does not bypass permission checks.

## Routing rules

- Unaddressed user message: send only to the workspace default recipient.
- Explicitly addressed user message: send to that participant.
- Agent delegation: send only to the addressed participant unless an explicit role policy allows the sender's role to delegate to the recipient's role.
- Broadcast: explicit opt-in operation, never the default.
- Agent-to-agent routed work becomes visible in the Lobby when workspace execution policy permits it.

The authoritative routing decision is represented by workspace messages and routing APIs; human-friendly addressing syntax is a UI/host convenience.

## Persistence

Persisted workspace state is partitioned by host application identity and the stable `UserId`. File storage remains local to the host installation; SQL Server and MySQL must prevent users in the same host application from reading or mutating another user's workspace state unless an explicit host/admin policy permits it.

Persisted workspace state includes workspace metadata, participant membership/roles/lifecycle state, lobby and private-chat history, approval requests/resolution state, safe statistics/activity metadata, selected workspace UX state where appropriate, and explicit workspace/shared-memory records.

Provider secrets, connection strings, live provider tasks, live `CancellationToken` state, runtime synchronization primitives, raw HTTP requests, raw provider payloads, and temporary execution objects are not workspace persistence concerns; the generic runtime phase already establishes those boundaries.

Agent private memory remains private unless explicit shared-memory policy grants workspace visibility.

## Workspace UI

The WinForms workspace is a compact, professional collaboration surface rather than a large dashboard. It contains a Lobby, participant/agent selection, access to private chats, approval presentation, and message composition. It must provide clear authorship and state without exposing implementation details.

The host interacts with the workspace through a public HAgent workspace facade rather than direct manipulation of internal WinForms controls. The facade provides lifecycle and communication operations conceptually equivalent to create, open/show, hide, close, agent join/leave, lobby send, private-chat open/send, and workspace state observation.

## Example verification

The Example application will expose explicit controls for creating, showing/opening, hiding, and closing the workspace UI, plus controlled agent join/leave and communication tests. Verification must confirm that closing the UI and restarting the application preserve the user's lobby/private chats, membership, approvals, selected state, and safe statistics for File, SQL Server, and MySQL storage.

## HWorld boundary

HWorld remains an external consumer. It references HAgent normally and uses public runtime/workspace APIs. HAgent does not add an HWorld-specific dependency, adapter, world type, physics, simulation scheduling, or action authority.

## Exit criterion

A host can identify a user, create/open the user's persisted default workspace, show and close the UI without losing work, join runtime agents, conduct visible lobby and private conversations, configure/select permitted manager/specialist agents and provider/model overrides, present and resolve approvals, and restore the same state after application restart while routing remains bounded and traceable.

## Phase 0.11 — Knowledge, Skills, Memory Governance + Learning

## Goal

Turn the existing memory/skill/wiki storage foundations into a coherent, provider-neutral knowledge and learning subsystem with explicit scope, capability inheritance, runtime overrides, and WinForms management surfaces.

## Architecture outcome

```text
Skills    = reusable executable capabilities/procedures
Knowledge = reusable retrievable information
Wiki      = managed persistent knowledge source
Memory    = scoped experience/state
Learning  = execution experience -> typed candidates -> policy -> promotion
```

Resources are shared/reusable by default; ownership and access are explicit through scope and authorization. Runtime instances inherit profile configuration but may override individual capability/resource states without mutating the profile.

## Learning modes

1. [ ] Add provider-neutral `LearningMode`: `Disabled`, `SuggestOnly`, `AutomaticWithPolicy`, `FullyAutomatic`.
2. [ ] Add learning policy contract covering candidate type, scope, confidence/evidence, provenance, contradiction checks, retention, and promotion authorization.
3. [ ] Add typed `MemoryCandidate`, `KnowledgeCandidate`, and `SkillCandidate` contracts.
4. [ ] Preserve execution/runtime/agent provenance on candidates.
5. [ ] Support deterministic code-derived learning signals without requiring an LLM.
6. [ ] Allow optional model-assisted extraction/classification without making the model the authority.
7. [ ] Keep promotion separate from candidate creation and keep published Skills versioned.

## Knowledge and Wiki

8. [ ] Define the provider-neutral knowledge resource/source contract and managed Wiki model.
9. [ ] Define resource scope, lifecycle/status, provenance, versioning, metadata, tags/categories, and relationships.
10. [ ] Define bounded retrieval contracts independent of keyword/vector/index implementation.
11. [ ] Support reusable shared knowledge plus agent/runtime scoped resources where authorized.
12. [ ] Prevent model-generated content from silently becoming authoritative knowledge.

## Skills

13. [ ] Define stable/versioned SkillDefinition and SkillSet/reference contracts.
14. [ ] Keep executable handlers separate from persisted definitions.
15. [ ] Support required knowledge, required tools, input/output contracts, preconditions, procedure steps, constraints, and lifecycle.
16. [ ] Preserve snapshot semantics so in-flight executions are not changed by later skill edits.
17. [ ] Support SkillCandidate -> validation -> new skill version workflow.

## Memory

18. [ ] Normalize memory families including working, episodic, semantic, procedural, and future extensible types.
19. [ ] Make memory scope explicit: execution, runtime, logical agent, user, tenant, or host-approved future scope.
20. [ ] Preserve the existing invariant that independent runtime instances never share private mutable memory ownership.
21. [ ] Keep storage implementation independent of memory ownership and retrieval policy.
22. [ ] Add memory-type enable/disable policy to agent profiles and runtime overrides.

## Capability policy

23. [ ] Add profile capability defaults for Skills, Knowledge/Wiki, Memory, and individual resources/types.
24. [ ] Add tri-state runtime override: `Inherit`, `Enabled`, `Disabled`.
25. [ ] Compute one effective immutable capability snapshot per execution.
26. [ ] Enforce capability policy before retrieval, exposure, or invocation.
27. [ ] Use stable resource/type identifiers so future knowledge types can be surfaced without changing the agent domain model.

## Management UI

28. [ ] Add Learning Review management surface with pending candidate list, inspection, provenance/evidence, source execution/runtime, target scope, approve, and reject.
29. [ ] Add Wiki/Knowledge Manager with New/Edit/Delete, search/filter, relationships, and "used by/accessed by agents" views.
30. [ ] Add Skill Manager with New/Edit/Delete, version/status, relationships, and "used by agents" views.
31. [ ] Extend Agent Configuration so selecting an agent shows effective Skills, Knowledge/Wiki, Memory families, and all generic future resource types.
32. [ ] Add profile-level capability switches for Skills, Wiki/Knowledge, Memory, and memory types.
33. [ ] Add runtime-instance-level override controls using `Inherit`/`Enabled`/`Disabled`.
34. [ ] Keep known types specialized while rendering unknown/future resource types through the generic inventory view.
35. [ ] Follow existing HAgent.WinForms conventions: `HMessage`, shared `Header`, `HButton`, and preserve existing layouts unless this phase requires a targeted change.

## Storage

36. [ ] Add HAgent-owned storage migrations for candidates, knowledge resources, skill relationships/versioning, capability assignments/overrides, and memory-type policy where required.
37. [ ] Keep File, SQL Server, and MySQL behavior aligned through provider-specific migrations.
38. [ ] Keep learning/review metadata secret-safe and bounded.

## Runtime integration

39. [ ] Bind effective knowledge/skill/memory policy into the runtime execution snapshot.
40. [ ] Capture execution outcomes/observations as learning input without mutating runtime identity.
41. [ ] Preserve runtime-instance isolation, execution correlation, cancellation, timeout, stale-result protection, and concurrent execution behavior.
42. [ ] Ensure runtime-only overrides never write back to the persistent profile.

## Verification

43. [ ] Add deterministic Example verification for scope isolation, inherited/overridden capability state, memory types, knowledge retrieval, skill binding, and learning candidates.
44. [ ] Add Example verification for SuggestOnly review and approval/rejection.
45. [ ] Add tests that a candidate cannot bypass authorization or directly mutate a published Wiki/Skill.
46. [ ] Add tests for future/unknown resource types surviving inventory and UI projection.
47. [ ] Add tests that existing executions retain immutable capability/skill snapshots after later edits.

## Exit criterion

A host can define reusable Skills and managed Wiki/knowledge, keep independent scoped runtime memories, enable/disable individual capability families and resources at profile or runtime level, run automatic or review-based learning through `LearningMode`, and administer all of it through HAgent.WinForms without introducing host-specific domain types into Core.

## Phase 1.0 — Collaboration + Workflows

## Goal
Turn basic workspace messaging into reliable multi-agent collaboration and then into bounded task/workflow execution.

## Collaboration steps

1. First-class delegation/handoff operations.
2. Shared/private workspace context policies.
3. Parallel specialist work with bounded collaboration budgets.
4. Human intervention and approval points.
5. Explicit runtime/participant lifecycle states.
6. Cross-agent memory sharing only through explicit policy.
7. Collaboration history, audit, and traceability.

## Workflow steps

1. Task/job model and lifecycle.
2. Planning, execution, and verification stages.
3. Multi-step and branching workflows.
4. Background execution and scheduling.
5. Pause/resume and durable checkpoints.
6. Event-triggered execution.
7. Per-step timeout, cancellation, retry, approval, and budget policies.

## Boundary

These are generic orchestration facilities. HAgent does not become the authority for business rules, simulation state, or host-side side effects.

## Exit criterion

A host can coordinate multiple agents and long-running work with bounded execution, explicit authority, resumable state where required, and observable collaboration.

## Later — Platform, Extensibility + Release

These capabilities follow the core runtime, data, and collaboration milestones. They should not block the primary host-integration path.

## Provider ecosystem

- [ ] Additional provider adapters such as Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, and custom HTTP providers where justified.
- [ ] Multimodal and embedding adapters.
- [ ] Provider capability/contract harness.

## Extensibility

- [ ] Provider, tool, UI-adapter, and storage extension model.
- [ ] Extension validation and failure isolation.
- [ ] External secret stores and secret rotation.
- [ ] Optional MCP/vector integrations where they fit the lightweight architecture.

## Developer platform

- [ ] Optional DI/interoperability integrations.
- [ ] Simulation/test mode for external consumers such as HWorld.
- [ ] Diagnostics/trace viewer.
- [ ] Complete Example coverage for meaningful public APIs.
- [ ] SDK guidance for provider, tool, UI-context, and host integrations.

## Release hardening

- [ ] Stable public contracts and compatibility policy.
- [ ] Storage migration/versioning.
- [ ] NuGet packaging and release process.
- [ ] Security/provider/tool/memory integration coverage.
- [ ] Documentation and migration guidance.

`.NET 10` remains a future target after the development environment and compatibility policy are ready.
