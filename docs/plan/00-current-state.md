# Current project state

## Project

HAgent is a lightweight, provider-neutral .NET agent runtime. It can be used for simple chat or embedded into a host application, simulation, game, or other environment.

## Supported targets

- .NET Framework 4.8.1
- .NET 9 where supported
- No GPU requirement
- Low-memory operation is a design constraint

## Current milestone

**0.8 Data Access + Authorization — active**

0.7 WinForms UI Context + Data Discovery is complete and locally verified.

## Verified implementation

The repository currently contains verified foundations for:

- provider/agent configuration and routing;
- execution lifecycle, timeout, cancellation, retries, diagnostics, and failure reporting;
- memory, persistent sessions, context budgeting, automatic/episodic/task memory;
- capability discovery and response normalization;
- streaming contracts and live streaming;
- tool definitions, registry, schema validation, provider transport, bounded tool loops, persistence, and per-agent assignment;
- WinForms UI Context with Form/UserControl attachment;
- semantic control and bound/native data-source discovery;
- CurrencyManager/current-item/source relationships;
- control-to-source relationship discovery;
- convention-based custom control adaptation;
- bounded application-object discovery;
- provider-neutral structured data projection/query contracts;
- `HAgent.Example` verification for the completed 0.7 UI/data capabilities.

## Active implementation

The active implementation plan is the current file `docs/plan/20-active.md`. It must contain only the work being implemented now.

## Verification rule

A capability becomes complete only after its implementation exists, its matching `HAgent.Example` verification passes locally, and the project documentation reflects the result.

Do not claim local build/test success unless it was actually performed.

## Documentation ownership

- `README.md` — public introduction and quick start.
- `AGENTS.md` — non-negotiable engineering and repository rules.
- `docs/architecture/` — stable architectural design and boundaries.
- `docs/plan/` — master direction, current state, and active implementation only.
- `docs/roadmap/` — ordered path from completed foundations to the long-term target.
- `docs/storage.md` — persistence/backend details.

The root `plan.md` and `roadmap.md` are generated from their source directories. They are views, not independent sources of truth.
